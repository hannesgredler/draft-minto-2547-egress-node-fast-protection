    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a mechanism for protecting RFC2547 based VPN
      service against egress node failure. The mechanism enables local repair
      to be performed immediately upon a egress PE failure. In particular, the
      router at point of local repair (PLR) can redirect VPN traffic to a
      protector to repair in the order of tens of milliseconds, achieving fast
      protection that is comparable to MPLS fast reroute.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document specifies a mechanism for protecting RFC 2547 based VPN
      against egress PE failure. The procedures in this document are relevant
      only when a VPN site is multi-homed to two or more PEs. This is designed
      on the basis of MPLS context specific label switching <xref
      target="RFC5331"/>. Fast-protection refers to the ability to provide
      local repair upon a failure in the order of tens of milliseconds, which
      is comparable to MPLS fast-reroute <xref target="RFC4090"/>. This is
      achieved by establishing local protection as close to a failure as
      possible. Compared with the existing global repair mechanisms that rely
      on control plane convergence, these procedures can provide faster
      restoration for VPN traffic. However, they are intended to complement
      the global repair mechanisms, rather than replacing them in any way.</t>

      <t>In Topology-1 two VPNs red and blue with two sites multihomed with
      PEs. Let assume blue and red VPN site2 prefixes required egress
      protection in case of PE5 goes down. PE5 is protected PE for site2
      prefixes for both VPN. PE4 is an alternative egress PE for red site2 prefixes. PE6
      is an alternative egress PE for blue site2 prefixes. PE4 could act as protector for
      red VPN site2 and PE6 could acts as protector for blue VPN site2. This
      model is called co-located protector model. Alternatively, RR could act as protector for both
      red and blue VPN site2. This is called centralized protector model (A node

      <t>In Topology-2 has a VPNs red with four sites and multihomed with PEs.
      Let assume red VPN site2 and site4 prefixes required egress protection
      in case of PE5 goes down. PE5 is protected PE for site2, site4 prefixes
      for red VPN. PE4 is alternate PE for site2 prefixes. PE6 is alternate PE
      for site4 prefixes. Either PE4 or PE6 could act as protector. This is a
      slight variation of the co-located model.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="theory" title="Theory of Operation">
      <t>The Egress PEs attached to multi-homed site export VPN prefixes with
      different route distinguisher, different nexthop but with same route
      target. The ingress PEs attached to other sites with same VPN import these
      route into VRF creating more than one path to multi-homed sites. When
      one egress PE goes down all VPN traffic towards the multihomed site
      moves to alternate egress PEs attached to the multi-homed site and this
      is done by ingress PE. The VPN traffic going through failed PE get
      dropped in penultimate hop router until ingress PE reroute the VPN
      traffic. Even though connectivity of multi-homed site is not bound to an
      egress PE the transport LSP bind to that egress PE. As result of down
      transport LSP VPN traffic gets dropped in P router. This document
      specifies a mechanism that repair VPN traffic at point of failure
      (typically a P router which penultimate hop of the transport LSP) and
      still keep P router unaware of the VPN information with the help of a
      protector. The PLR send VPN traffic to protector through bypass LSP
      incase of egress PE failure. This protector send VPN traffic received
      from PLR to the alternative egress PE until the ingress PE reroute traffic
      to alternate egress PE.</t>

      <section title="Protector and Protection Models">
        <t>Protector, is a new role, could be played by the alternate egress
        PE, another PE or any other nodes which participates in VPN control plane for VPN
        prefixes that requires egress node protection.</t>
	    <t>We defined three types of protector (co-located, centralized, hybrid) depending
		on the protector having direct links to the backup site for all VPNs, non, or some.
		A network MAY use either protection model or a combination depending on requirements and network topology.</t>

        <section title="Co-located protector">
          <t>In this model, protector role is played by the alternate egress PE
          for a protected prefix. It is co-located with the alternate PE for
          the protected prefix, and it has a direct connection to the
          multi-homed site that originate the protected prefix. In the event
          of an egress node failure, the protector receives traffic from the
          PLR, and sends VPN traffic to the multi-homed site. In the <xref
          pageno="false" target="Topology-1"/> PE4 could act as co-located
          protector for red VPN site2 and PE6 could acts as co-located
          protector for blue VPN site2. </t>

          <t>A slight variant of this model is, protector is not alternate PE
          for a protected prefix but has same VRF. In the topology-2 either
          PE4 or PE6 could act as protector. This is example for the above
          model.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Centralized protector">
          <t>In this model, the protector serves as a centralized protector
          and does not have a direct connection to multi-homed site. This model can
          be played by existing PEs or a dedicated protector. In the event of
          an egress PE failure, protector MUST forwards the traffic to an
          alternate egress PE with the VPN label advertised by the alternate egress PE
          for the prefix which in turn forwards the traffic to the multi-homed
          site. In the topology-1 RR could act as protector for both red and
          blue VPN site2. This is centralized protector model (A PE protecting
          set of VPNs and not connected to any VPN site).</t>

          <t>A network MAY use either protection model or a combination of
          both, depending on requirements.</t>
        </section>
		
		      <section title="Hybrid protector">
          <t>In this model, the protector is a co-located protector for some VPNs
		  (for which the multi-homed site has a direct connection with the hybrid protector)
		  and a centralized protector for others VPNs.</t>

        </section>
	
      </section>

      <section title="Context Identifier and VPN prefixes.">
        <t>The context-identifier is an IP address that is either globally
        unique or unique in the private address space of the routing domain.
        In Egress PE each VPN prefix is assigned to a context-identifier. The
        granularity of a context identifier is {Egress PE, VPN prefix} tuple.
        However, a given context identifier MAY be assigned to one or multiple
        VPN prefixes.</t>
		
		 <t>A given context identifier MUST NOT be used by more than one
        protected PE. The egress PE that required protection for a VPN prefix
        MUST set context-identifier as BGP nexthop for VPN-IPv4 and IPv4-Mapped
        context-identifier for VPN-IPv6. This context-identifier
        as nexthop indicates to protector that this prefix need protection.
        For e.g. in topology 1 PE5 (protected PE) advertises VPN prefixes with
        context-identifier as BGP nexthop. The context identifier MUST also be 
		advertised in the IGP and in LDP if LDP is used to establish transport LSP.</t>
		

        <t>Possible context identifier assignments are <list style="symbols">
            <t>Unique context-identifier for all VPN prefixes, both VPN-IPv4
            and VPN-IPv6.</t>

            <t>Unique context-identifier per address family.</t>

            <t>Unique context-identifier per site for all VPN prefixes, both
            VPN-IPv4 and VPN-IPv6.</t>

            <t>Unique context-identifier per site per address family.</t>

            <t>Unique context-identifier per CE address (nexthop).</t>

            <t>Unique context identifier for each prefix.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The first one is coarsest granularity of a context identifier and
        the last one is finest granularity of a context identifier. While all
        of the above options are possible in principle, their practical usage
        is likely to vary widely, as not all of them may be of practical
        usage.</t>
       </section>

	      <section anchor="forwarding" title="Forwarding State on Protector PE">
        <t>A protector maintain the forwarding state in context-specific label
        spaces on a per context-Identifier basis. In particular, protector
        MUST learn VPN labels by participating in VPN routing and MUST keep
        all routes associated with a VPN that required protection.</t>

        <t>For each VPN label with an associated context-identifier, protector
        MUST map the context identifier to a context-specific label space [RFC
        5331], and program the VPN label in that label space in forwarding
        plane. For each VPN prefix that required protection programmed in the
        forwarding plane with BGP nexthop to alternate egress PE in context
        VPN table. This VPN label in the context-specific label space identify
        the layer-3 forwarding table, context VPN table, that need to lookup
        to send it alternate egress PE.</t>

        <t>The protector MAY maintain only VPN prefix originated with-in the
        multi-homed site for given {egress PE, VPN}. These VPN labels in
        context table and context VRF will not be used in forwarding after
        ingress reroute the traffic to alternative PE. Protector MUST delete
        VPN label and the VPN context table after ingress reroute the traffic.
        This shall be achieved with a timer. This timer default value is 180
        seconds.</t>
		
		<t>Note that if the protected PE advertised a label per prefix, as 
		an optimization, the protector PE does not need to create an IP VPN forwarding table
		as the MPLS lookup on the VPN label is enough to identify the outgoing 
		PE and label.</t>

    <section anchor="PE_failure" title=" Egress node Failure">
      <t>This section summarizes the procedure for egress protection described
      above section for completeness. A Egress PE, Protector, PLR follows the
      methods described in <xref target="MPLS-egress-frr"/>. The protector
      programs forwarding state in such a way that packets received on the
      bypass LSP will be forwarded based on VPN label in the context table,
      and prefix lookup in context VPN table. The context table identified by
      the UHP label of the bypass LSP, i.e. the context identifier.</t>

      <t>When the penultimate Hop router receives a VPN packet from the MPLS
      network, if the egress PE is down, the PLR tunnels the packet through
      the bypass LSP to the protector. The protector PE identifies the
      forwarding context of the egress PE based on the top label of the packet
      which is the UHP label of the bypass LSP. Then forwards protector the
      packet based on a second label lookup in the protected PE's context
      label space followed by layer-3 lookup in the VPN context table. These
      UHP label, context table label and layer-3 lookup results in forwarding
      the packet to the site or send it to alternate egress PE based on
      protector model.</t>

      <t>For E.g. In topology-1 RR is act as Protector and PE5 required
      protection for red, blue site2 prefixes. As red, blue site2 VPN prefixes
      advertised with context-identifier, the protector set up the forwarding
      table for prefixes from site2 with alternative egress PE as nexthop.
      When PLR detects PE5 failure it send to protector through bypass LSP. In
      protector the top label identify the context space table. VPN label in
      the context table identify the VPN layer-3 forwarding table with
      contains site2 prefixes with alternate PE as nexthop. A Layer-3 lookup
      gives mpls path to alternate egress PE and protector forward packet to
      alternate egress PE and reach to the site2.</t>

	    <section anchor="Deployment" title="Deployement Considerations">
      
	     <section title="Discussion on deployment models.">
    	   
		<t> As the context-identifiers are advertised in the IGP,
		they introduce additional states in the network and the forwarding tables.
		As such, in general, it's desirable to keep their number limited. 
		The granularity of context-identifier is also related to the protector model used.
		If a centralized or hybrid protector model is used, a unique context-identifier
		per egress PE is enough.
		If a co-located protector model is used, a context identifier
		per VPN or per CE may be simpler. If one wish to minimize the number of context identifier,
		one context-identifier per alternative egress PE is the absolute minimum but this comes at 
		the price of additional BGP route churn when BGP routes from a dual-attached site are newly advertised
		as the routes from the first PE will first be advertised with the usual BGP Next-Hop and then be re-advertised
		with the correct context-identifier once the backup PE advertise the same routes.
		Assuming a site dual-homed to two routers in the same POP/geographic region, the upper bound 
		is the number of edge routers in the POP/region.</t>
		
		<t> The centralized protector model, using a single context identifier per protected PE, limits the number of
		additional states in the network (IGP, forwarding tables) but may add extra latency during the protection time.
		It also minimizes the configuration effort as zero configuration is achievable.
		On the contrary the co-located mode, having a more granualar context identifier, will minimize the latency during 
		the protection time at the cost of adding more states in the network. It requires more configuration as the service
		provider will need to defines the PE pairs (protected, protector).
		The hybrid model is expected to offer the best trade-off as the number of IGP states in the network can be minimized
		by using a single context identifier per protected PE, while the additional latency
		can be limited by geographically distributing the protector PE in the network. </t>

        <t>We propose the following simple deployment model:  <list style="symbols">
            <t>a single centralized Protector PE.</t>
			<t>a single context-identifier per protected PE, with all VPN routes advertised with this context-identifier as BGP next-hop.</t>
          </list></t>
		
		 <t>It provides the following benefits:  <list style="symbols">
            <t>minimize the number of IGP states in the network. </t>
			<t>minimize the configuration required: no per VPN nor PE configuration on the protector PE.</t>
          </list></t>
		
		<t> Regarding the IGP states, no additional states is required if the PEs already have multiple loopbacks. Otherwise, one additional loopback per PE need to be advertised. However, the number of loopbacks used as BGP next-hop for the customer traffic is not increased, hence if the routers allows the prioritization of the prefix during FIP update, there is no impact on the IGP convergence time. </t>
		
		<t> Regarding the configuration required on the network: <list style="symbols">
        <t> The protected PE is configured once with an additional loopback which serves as a context identifier. The BGP Next-Hop of the BGP routes are set to this loopback.</t>
		<t> The centralized protector PE has no per VPN nor per protected PE configuration. It listens to VPN routes. When it sees more than one PE advertising a prefix with the same set of Route Targets, then it creates the context specific label space and advertise the BGP Next-Hops in LDP and in the IGP with a high metric. </t>
		 </list></t>
		 
		<t> If one want to limit the protection to only a subset of VPN or a subset of PE (for marketing reasons, FIB capacities reasons on the protector, forwarding capacity reason during the protection time, for the hybrid model), one may have the protected PE attach a specific community to the routes of such VPN. If the hybrid model is used, on community per protector PE is needed. This is a per VPN configuration on the protected PE when the VPN is provisionned. If the main reason is the forwarding capacity during the protection time, the community can be attached to all dual attached VPN. This usually does not require additional per VPN configuration as typically those dual attached VPN are already tagged for load-balancing requirements. The downside is that both PE loopback are used for trafic forwarding and hence one cannot be de-prioritized during IGP convergence. </t>

	  <t>This solution does not require protocol extension on any router. It does not require any feature on any router except the new protector PE. In particular, it does not requires implementation change on ingress nor egress PE, hence works with legacy PE. In most topology, when LDP is used, the PLR will need to support the use of a LDP LSP as a targeted LFA. This is similar to R-LFA but the ability to configure a specific LSP to reach the protector PE may be specific.</t>
